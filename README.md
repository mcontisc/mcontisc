### Hi 👋 I am Martina!  

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://networkdatascience.ceu.edu/">Department of Network and Data Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.ceu.edu/">Central European University</a> (Vienna, Austria).

I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the <a href="https://is.mpg.de/">Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems</a> and the <a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/">University of Tübingen</a>, supervised by <a href="https://www.cdebacco.com/">Dr.Caterina De Bacco</a>, with a doctoral dissertation entitled "Probabilistic Generative Models for Inference on Complex Systems". 

🔍 My research focuses on the development of **statistical methods and algorithms to analyze network data**.
